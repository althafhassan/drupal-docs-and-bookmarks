title: 'Things to consider before using a module'
---

Accessing a Drupal module before using.

Review code.

* Understand use case.

* Some instance module might be more than you need. 

* See support status. Is there recent updates?

* Ideally we want stable modules but since most the modules are not in stable state check the module roadmap.

* See the pending issue queue.

* Install and code scan using sonarqube.
